# A/B Testing

The A/B Testing feature enables systematic comparison of different AI models, parameters, and workflow designs to optimize performance and cost.

## Overview

Compare multiple variations of your workflows to find the optimal configuration. Test different models, prompts, parameters, and even workflow structures to make data-driven decisions.

## Creating Experiments

### Basic Setup

1. Navigate to **A/B Testing** tab
2. Click **New Experiment**
3. Configure:
   - Experiment name
   - Test duration
   - Success metrics
   - Variant count

### Defining Variants

Each variant can differ in:
- **AI Model**: GPT-4 vs Claude vs Gemini
- **Parameters**: Temperature, max tokens, etc.
- **Prompts**: Different instruction styles
- **Workflow Structure**: Alternative node arrangements

### Example Configuration

```yaml
Experiment: Content Generation Optimization
Variant A:
  - Model: GPT-4
  - Temperature: 0.7
  - Prompt: "Write engaging content..."
  
Variant B:
  - Model: Claude-3
  - Temperature: 0.5
  - Prompt: "Create compelling content..."
```

## Metrics & Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
- **Speed**: Execution time per variant
- **Cost**: Token usage and API costs
- **Success Rate**: Completion percentage
- **Quality Score**: Based on evaluation criteria

### Custom Evaluation
Define success criteria:
- Output length requirements
- Keyword presence
- Sentiment scores
- Custom scoring functions

### Statistical Analysis
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical significance
- **P-Values**: Variant comparison
- **Effect Size**: Magnitude of differences
- **Sample Size**: Required test runs

## Running Experiments

- **Single Variable**: Change one thing at a time
- **Sufficient Sample**: Ensure statistical power
- **Representative Data**: Use realistic inputs

### Running Tests
- Start with small samples
- Monitor early results
- Check for anomalies
- Document findings

### Acting on Results
- Implement winning variants
- Run confirmation tests
- Monitor production performance
- Iterate continuously

## Integration

### With Visual Designer
- Create variant workflows
- Import to A/B testing
- Apply winning configs

### With Analytics
- Deep dive into results
- Historical comparisons
- Cost projections

## Examples

### Cost Optimization Test

**Goal**: Reduce costs while maintaining quality

**Setup**:
- Variant A: GPT-4 (baseline)
- Variant B: GPT-3.5-turbo
- Variant C: Claude-3-haiku

**Results**: Variant C provides 70% cost reduction with only 5% quality decrease

### Speed Optimization Test

**Goal**: Faster response times

**Setup**:
- Variant A: Sequential processing
- Variant B: Parallel processing
- Variant C: Cached + parallel

**Results**: Variant C reduces latency by 65%

## Limitations

- Maximum 10 variants per experiment
- Tests require minimum 100 executions
- Some metrics require manual evaluation
- Real-time results may vary
