# AI Assistant

The AI Assistant provides a natural language interface for creating and modifying workflows without manual node manipulation.

## Overview

Instead of dragging and dropping nodes, you can describe what you want to build in plain English. The AI Assistant understands your intent and automatically generates the appropriate workflow structure.

## Using the AI Assistant

### Starting a Conversation

1. Navigate to the **AI Assistant** tab
2. Type your workflow description in the chat input
3. Press Enter or click Send

### Example Prompts

**Simple Workflow**
```
"Create a workflow that takes a topic and writes a blog post about it"
```

**Multi-Step Process**
```
"Build a research assistant that searches the web, analyzes results, and creates a summary report"
```

**Tool Integration**
```
"I need a workflow that generates a report and saves it to Google Docs"
```

## Workflow Generation

### How It Works

1. **Intent Analysis**: AI understands your requirements
2. **Node Selection**: Chooses appropriate agents and tools
3. **Connection Logic**: Determines data flow
4. **Configuration**: Sets optimal parameters

### Generated Elements

- Appropriate agent nodes with instructions
- Required tool nodes for external actions
- Input/output nodes for data flow
- Logical connections between components

## Refinement

### Modifying Workflows

You can refine generated workflows with follow-up instructions:

- "Add a web search step before analysis"
- "Change the model to GPT-4"
- "Include error handling"
- "Make it more cost-efficient"

### Interactive Improvements

The assistant can:
- Explain workflow logic
- Suggest optimizations
- Add missing components
- Fix configuration issues

## Advanced Features

### Context Understanding

The AI Assistant maintains conversation context:
- Remembers previous requests
- Builds upon existing workflows
- Understands references to prior steps

### Smart Suggestions

Based on your description, it may suggest:
- Additional tools that could help
- More efficient approaches
- Cost-saving alternatives
- Best practices

### Template Recognition

Common patterns are recognized:
- Research workflows
- Content generation
- Data processing
- API integrations

## Integration with Visual Designer

### Seamless Transition

Workflows created in AI Assistant can be:
- Viewed in Visual Designer
- Manually edited and refined
- Executed immediately
- Saved as templates

### Bidirectional Sync

Changes made in either interface are reflected:
- AI modifications update visual layout
- Manual edits are understood by AI
- Consistent state across interfaces

## Best Practices

### Clear Descriptions

**Good:**
- "Create a workflow that analyzes customer feedback and categorizes it by sentiment"
- "Build a system to monitor GitHub issues and create Jira tickets"

**Less Effective:**
- "Make something that processes data"
- "I need an AI workflow"

### Iterative Building

1. Start with core functionality
2. Test the basic workflow
3. Add features incrementally
4. Refine based on results

### Specific Requirements

Include details about:
- Preferred AI models
- External tools needed
- Input/output formats
- Performance constraints

## Examples

### Content Creation Workflow

**Prompt:**
```
"Create a workflow for writing SEO-optimized articles. It should research keywords, generate an outline, write the content, and optimize for search engines."
```

**Generated Workflow:**
1. Input Node (topic)
2. Agent Node (keyword research)
3. Web Search Tool
4. Agent Node (outline generation)
5. Agent Node (content writing)
6. Agent Node (SEO optimization)
7. Output Node (final article)

### Automation Workflow

**Prompt:**
```
"Build a workflow that monitors our support email, categorizes issues, creates tickets in our system, and sends acknowledgment emails."
```

**Generated Workflow:**
1. Email Monitor Tool
2. Agent Node (categorization)
3. Ticket Creation Tool
4. Agent Node (response drafting)
5. Email Send Tool

## Tips

### Efficiency
- Describe the end goal clearly
- Mention specific tools if needed
- Include performance requirements
- Specify any constraints

### Debugging
- Ask the AI to explain the workflow
- Request step-by-step breakdowns
- Get suggestions for improvements
- Verify tool configurations

### Learning
- Start with simple workflows
- Gradually increase complexity
- Study generated patterns
- Apply learnings to manual design
