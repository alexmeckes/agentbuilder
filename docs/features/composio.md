# Composio Integration

Transform your AI workflows into real-world automation with access to 100+ production-ready tools.

## Overview

Composio integration enables Any-Agent workflows to interact with real external services like Google Workspace, GitHub, Slack, CRM systems, and more. This transforms theoretical AI workflows into practical business automation.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Composio API Key

1. Sign up at [app.composio.dev](https://app.composio.dev)
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Generate a new API key

### 2. Connect Your Apps

In the Composio dashboard:
- Click "Add Integration"
- Select apps you want to use (Google Docs, GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Grant full permissions (read + write access)

### 3. Configure Any-Agent

1. Open Any-Agent Workflow Composer
2. Click Settings icon (top-right)
3. Add your Composio API key
4. Click "Test Connection"
5. Save settings

Your connected apps will be automatically discovered and available as tools in workflows.

## Best Practices

### Tool Selection
- Choose tools based on your existing tech stack
- Start with 2-3 core integrations
- Test workflows thoroughly before production use

### Security
- Store API keys securely
- Use minimal required permissions
- Regularly audit connected apps
- Monitor tool usage

### Performance
- Batch operations when possible
- Use caching for repeated queries
- Set appropriate rate limits
- Monitor API quotas

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"No tools discovered"**
- Verify API key is correct
- Check app connections in Composio dashboard
- Ensure apps have proper permissions

**"Tool execution failed"**
- Check tool-specific error messages
- Verify app is still connected
- Check API quotas and limits

### Common Errors

**Authentication Failed**
- Re-connect the app in Composio
- Generate new API key if needed
- Check permission scopes

**Rate Limit Exceeded**
- Implement retry logic
- Reduce request frequency
- Upgrade Composio plan if needed

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Tool Discovery
Tools are discovered based on your connected apps, so available actions update automatically as you connect new services.

### Custom Parameters
AI agents can intelligently fill tool parameters based on context, reducing manual configuration.

### Error Handling
Built-in retry logic and graceful degradation ensure workflows continue even if individual tools fail.

## Limitations

- API rate limits apply per service
- Some actions require premium Composio plans
- Complex workflows may need optimization
- Real-time triggers not yet supported

## Future Enhancements

- Webhook support for real-time triggers
- Custom tool creation interface
- Advanced workflow templates
- Team collaboration features
