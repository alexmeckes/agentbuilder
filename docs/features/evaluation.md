# Workflow Evaluation

The Evaluation system enables comprehensive testing and quality assessment of your AI workflows using LLM-as-a-Judge and custom evaluation criteria.

## Overview

Test and validate your workflows with a sophisticated evaluation framework that supports multiple evaluation types, custom criteria, and detailed performance analysis.

## Key Features

### LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation
- Use advanced language models to evaluate workflow outputs
- Define custom evaluation criteria
- Automated quality scoring
- Consistent evaluation across test cases

### Evaluation Types

**Checkpoint Evaluation**
- Evaluate specific points in workflow execution
- Track intermediate results
- Identify performance bottlenecks

**Hypothesis Testing**
- Test specific assumptions about workflow behavior
- Validate expected outcomes
- Statistical significance analysis

**Direct Q&A Evaluation**
- Question-answer format testing
- Automated correctness checking
- Support for multiple answer formats

**Trace-Based Evaluation**
- Analyze full execution traces
- Evaluate decision paths
- Performance pattern recognition

## Creating Evaluations

### 1. Define Evaluation Cases

Create test cases in YAML format:

```yaml
name: Customer Support Evaluation
description: Test customer service workflow quality
cases:
  - id: polite_response
    input: "I'm frustrated with your service"
    expected_behavior: "Polite and helpful response"
    
  - id: technical_accuracy
    input: "How do I reset my password?"
    expected_behavior: "Accurate technical instructions"
```

### 2. Set Evaluation Criteria

Define what constitutes success:

```yaml
criteria:
  - name: Politeness
    weight: 0.3
    description: "Response should be courteous and professional"
    
  - name: Accuracy
    weight: 0.5
    description: "Information provided must be correct"
    
  - name: Completeness
    weight: 0.2
    description: "All aspects of query addressed"
```

### 3. Configure Judge Model

Select the LLM to use for evaluation:
- GPT-4 for nuanced evaluation
- Claude for detailed analysis
- Custom models for specific domains

## Running Evaluations

### Test Execution

1. **Select Workflow**: Choose workflow to evaluate
2. **Load Test Cases**: Import YAML configuration
3. **Configure Parameters**: Set evaluation model and criteria
4. **Run Tests**: Execute evaluation suite

### Real-time Monitoring

- Progress indicators for each test case
- Live scoring updates
- Error detection and reporting
- Resource usage tracking

## Results Analysis

### Metrics Dashboard

View comprehensive evaluation results:
- **Overall Score**: Aggregate performance metric
- **Criteria Breakdown**: Score by evaluation criterion
- **Case-by-Case Results**: Individual test performance
- **Trend Analysis**: Performance over time

### Detailed Reports

For each evaluation run:
- Test case inputs and outputs
- Judge model reasoning
- Score breakdowns
- Improvement recommendations

### Comparative Analysis

Compare evaluations across:
- Different workflow versions
- Various model configurations
- Parameter adjustments
- Time periods

## Best Practices

### Test Case Design

**Coverage**
- Include edge cases
- Test common scenarios
- Cover error conditions
- Validate happy paths

**Diversity**
- Vary input complexity

## Advanced Features

### Custom Evaluators

Create specialized evaluation logic:
```python
def custom_evaluator(output, expected):
    # Custom evaluation logic
    return score, reasoning
```

### Batch Evaluation

Run evaluations across:
- Multiple workflows simultaneously
- Different model variants
- Parameter sweeps
- A/B test variants

### Integration

Connect evaluations with:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing
- Performance monitoring
- Alert systems

## Use Cases
