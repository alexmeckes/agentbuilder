# Web Search Tool Fix Summary

## Problem
The web search tool was not being properly spawned when workflows required it because:
1. Frontend sends `tool_type: 'web_search'`
2. Backend any-agent library expects `search_web`
3. Tool mapping was inconsistent across different workflow patterns

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Tool Type Resolution** (visual_to_anyagent_translator.py)
- Added comprehensive tool type extraction from multiple locations:
  - `node.data.tool_type` (primary)
  - `node.data.type` (fallback)
  - `node.type` (last resort)
- Added normalization for hyphens to underscores
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. **Expanded Tool Aliases**
- Main translator initialization includes all aliases:
  ```python
  "web_search": search_web,  # Frontend alias
  "WebSearch": search_web,   # UI display name
  ```
- Subprocess execution also includes all aliases for consistency

### 3. **Improved Debugging**
- Added `debug_available_tools()` method to log all available tools
- Enhanced logging in tool resolution process
- Clear warnings when tools are not found

### 4. **Consistent Tool Mapping Across Patterns**
- Fixed tool mapping in:
  - `_create_simple_multi_agent()` - for connected tools
  - `_create_sequential_multi_agent()` - for sequential workflows
  - `_create_collaborative_multi_agent()` - for collaborative workflows

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify:
1. Tool type mapping works correctly
2. All aliases resolve to the correct function
3. Frontend's `web_search` maps to backend's `search_web`

## Result
Web search tools will now be properly spawned when:
- User adds a "Web Search" tool from the UI
- AI assistant suggests a web search tool in a workflow
- Any workflow requires web searching functionality

The fix ensures seamless integration between the frontend tool definitions and backend any-agent execution.
